To-Do List for CF 8
===================

Already done
------------

- Initial name change
- Changing the constants to make the plugin compatible with WP 4.9.x (and thus, also CP) again
- Commenting out the block editor component include


Things yet to do
----------------

- find occurances of "Contact Form 7" string and curate them carefully, ie. change them only when appropiate, to avoid compatiblity issues with CF 7 addons
- full removal of the block editor code
- backward compatiblity checks and tests to avoid collisions with pre-existing CF 7 installs
- enhancing this to-do-list :)
- duplicating and adapting the documentation etc. to Github Wiki or a separate site (eg. github.io)
